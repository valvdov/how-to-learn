# How-to-learn
---
My first project written entirely in HTML and CSS. This site is a practical work in progress during the [Yandex Practicum](https://practicum.com/)

The site implements the BEM structure and uses CSS animations. There are many links that will lead to other pages of the site (or other sites) in the future. There is also a transition parameter for links
